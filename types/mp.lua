---
--- - _`ass-events`_:
---
---   The data parameter is a string. The string is split on the newline character. Every line is turned into the Text part of a Dialogue ASS event. Timing is unused (but behavior of timing dependent ASS tags may change in future mpv versions).
---
---   Note that it's better to put multiple lines into data, instead of adding multiple OSD overlays.
---
---   This provides 2 ASS Styles. OSD contains the text style as defined by the current `--osd-...` options. Default is similar, and contains style that OSD would have if all options were set to the default.
---
---   In addition, the res_x and res_y options specify the value of the ASS PlayResX and PlayResY header fields. If res_y is set to 0, PlayResY is initialized to an arbitrary default value (but note that the default for this command is 720, not 0).
---   If res_x is set to 0, PlayResX is set based on res_y such that a virtual ASS pixel has a square pixel aspect ratio.
---
--- - _`none`_:
---
---   Special value that causes the overlay to be removed. Most parameters other than id and format are mostly ignored.

--region Commands

---
--- Run the given command. This is similar to the commands used in input.conf.
--- See _`List of Input Commands`_.
---
--- By default, this will show something on the OSD (depending on the command),
--- as if it was used in `input.conf`. See `Input Command Prefixes` how
--- to influence OSD usage per command.
---
--- Returns `true` on success, or `nil, error` on error.
---
---@param   command string
---@return  boolean | boolean
---@return  MaybeError? CommandError
function mp.command(command) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.command`, but pass each command argument as separate
--- parameter. This has the advantage that you don't have to care about
--- quoting and escaping in some cases.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ``` lua
--- mp.command("loadfile " .. filename .. " append")
--- mp.commandv("loadfile", filename, "append")
--- ```
---
--- These two commands are equivalent, except that the first version breaks
--- if the filename contains spaces or certain special characters.
---
--- Note that properties are *not* expanded.  You can use either `mp.command`,
--- the `expand-properties` prefix, or the `mp.get_property` family of
--- functions.
---
--- Unlike `mp.command`, this will not use OSD by default either (except
--- for some OSD-specific commands).
---
---@vararg   string
---@return   true | nil
---@return   MaybeError?
function mp.commandv(...) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.commandv`, but pass the argument list as table. This has
--- the advantage that in at least some cases, arguments can be passed as
--- native types. It also allows you to use named argument.
---
--- If the table is an array, each array item is like an argument in
--- `mp.commandv()` (but can be a native type instead of a string).
---
--- If the table contains string keys, it's interpreted as command with named
--- arguments. This requires at least an entry with the key `name` to be
--- present, which must be a string, and contains the command name. The special
--- entry `_flags` is optional, and if present, must be an array of
--- `Input Command Prefixes` to apply. All other entries are interpreted as
--- arguments.
---
--- Returns a result table on success (usually empty), or `def, error` on
--- error. `def` is the second parameter provided to the function, and is
--- `nil` if it's missing.
---
---@param  command table
---@return boolean | 'true' | nil
---@return MaybeError?
function mp.command_native(command) end

---
--- Like `mp.command_native()`, but the command is ran asynchronously (as far
--- as possible), and upon completion, fn is called. fn has two arguments:
--- `fn(success, result, error)`. `success` is always a Boolean and is true
--- if the command was successful, otherwise false. The second parameter is
--- the result value (can be nil) in case of success, nil otherwise (as returned
--- by `mp.command_native()`). The third parameter is the error string in case
--- of an error, nil otherwise.
---
--- Returns a table with undefined contents, which can be used as argument for
--- `mp.abort_async_command`.
---
--- If starting the command failed for some reason, `nil, error` is returned,
--- and `fn` is called indicating failure, using the same error value.
---
---@overload fun(command: table, fn: AsyncCommmandCallback): AsyncCommandKey
---@param  command table
---@return         AsyncCommandKey
function mp.command_native_async(command) end

---
--- Abort a `mp.command_native_async` call. The argument is the return value
--- of that command (which starts asynchronous execution of the command).
--- Whether this works and how long it takes depends on the command and the
--- situation. The abort call itself is asynchronous. Does not return anything.
---
---@param async_command_return AsyncCommandKey
function mp.abort_async_command(async_command_return) end

--endregion Commands

--region Property Access

---
--- Return the value of the given property as string. These are the same
--- properties as used in input.conf. See _`Properties`_ for a list of
--- properties. The returned string is formatted similar to `${=name}`
--- (see _`Property Expansion`_).
---
--- Returns the string on success, or `def, error` on error. `def` is the
--- second parameter provided to the function, and is nil if it's missing.
---
---@overload fun(name: string, def: string): string, MaybeError
---@param  name string
---@return      string
function mp.get_property(name) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value formatted for
--- OSD. This is the same string as printed with `${name}` when used in
--- input.conf.
---
--- Returns the string on success, or `def, error` on error. `def` is the
--- second parameter provided to the function, and is an empty string if it's
--- missing. Unlike `get_property()`, assigning the return value to a variable
--- will always result in a string.
---
---@overload fun(name: string, def: D): string, MaybeError
---@param  name string
---@return      string
function mp.get_property_osd(name) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value as Boolean.
---
--- Returns a Boolean on success, or `def, error` on error.
---
---@param  name string
---@return      boolean
function mp.get_property_bool(name) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value as number.
---
--- Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats,
--- mpv internals do. This function simply request a double float from mpv,
--- and mpv will usually convert integer property values to float.
---
--- Returns a number on success, or `def, error` on error.
---
---@generic D : number | nil
---@param   name string
---@param   def? D
---@return       number | D, MaybeError
function mp.get_property_number(name, def) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value using the best
--- Lua type for the property. Most time, this will return a string, Boolean,
--- or number. Some properties (for example `chapter-list`) are returned as
--- tables.
---
--- Returns a value on success, or `def, error` on error. Note that `nil`
--- might be a possible, valid value too in some corner cases.
---
---@generic  D : string | boolean | number | table | nil
---@param    name string
---@param    def? D
---@return        D, MaybeError
function mp.get_property_native(name, def) end

---
--- Set the given property to the given string value. See `mp.get_property`
--- and `Properties` for more information about properties.
---
--- Returns true on success, or `nil, error` on error.
---
---@param  name  string
---@param  value string
---@return       true | nil, MaybeError
function mp.set_property(name, value) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.set_property`, but sets `boolean` property of name `name` to `value`.
---
---@param  name  string
---@param  value boolean
---@return       true | nil, MaybeError
function mp.set_property_bool(name, value) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.set_property`, but set the given property to the given
--- numeric value.
---
--- Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats, mpv internals do.
---
---This function will test whether the number can be represented as integer, and if so, it will pass an integer value to mpv, otherwise a double float.
---
---@param  name  string
---@param  value number
---@return       true | nil, MaybeError
function mp.set_property_number(name, value) end

---
--- Similar to `mp.set_property`, but set the given property using its native
--- type.
---
--- Since there are several data types which cannot represented natively in Lua, this might not always work as expected. For example, while the Lua wrapper can do some guesswork to decide whether a Lua table is an array or a map, this would fail with empty tables. Also, there are not many properties for which it makes sense to use this, instead of `set_property`, `set_property_bool`, `set_property_number`. For these reasons, this function should probably be avoided for now, except for properties that use tables natively.
---
---@param  name  string
---@param  value any
---@return       true | nil, MaybeError
function mp.set_property_native(name, value) end

---
--- Search for the input filename in several paths. These include user and global config locations by default. Some platforms may implement additional platform related lookups (i.e.: macOS inside an application bundle).
---
--- \- `mpv/options/path.h`
---
---@param  filename string
---@return          string | nil
function mp.find_config_file(filename) end

---
--- Return the current mpv internal time in seconds as a number. This is basically the system time, with an arbitrary offset.
---
---@return number
function mp.get_time() end

--endregion Property Access

--region OSD Controls

-- @TODO: Confirm return types
---
--- Return width, height, and aspect ratio of on-screen display
---
---@return number, number, number
function mp.get_osd_size() end

---
--- Display a message at provided position.
---
---@param  screenx integer
---@param  screeny integer
---@param  message string
---@return         nil
function mp.set_osd_ass(screenx, screeny, message) end

---
--- Create an OSD overlay. This is a very thin wrapper around the `osd-overlay` command. The function returns a table, which mostly contains fields that will be passed to osd-overlay. The format parameter is used to initialize the format field. The data field contains the text to be used as overlay. For details, see the `osd-overlay` command.
---
--- In addition, it provides the following methods:
---
--- - _`update()`_:
---
--- Commit the OSD overlay to the screen, or in other words, run the `osd-overlay` command with the current fields of the overlay table. Returns the result of the osd-overlay command itself.
---
--- - _`remove()`_:
---
--- Remove the overlay from the screen. A update() call will add it again.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ``` lua
---     ov = mp.create_osd_overlay("ass-events")
---     ov.data = "{\\an5}{\\b1}hello world!"
---     ov:update()
--- ```
---
--- The advantage of using this wrapper (as opposed to running `osd-overlay` directly) is that the `id` field is allocated automatically.
---
---@param  format OSD_Format
---@return        OSD_Overlay
function mp.create_osd_overlay(format) end

--endregion OSD Controls

--region Key Bindings

---@class KeybindFlags
---@field public repeatable boolean | nil @ If set to `true`, enables key repeat for this specific binding.
---@field public complex    boolean | nil

---
--- Register callback to be run on a key binding. The binding will be mapped to the given `key`, which is a string describing the physical key. This uses the same key names as in input.conf, and also allows combinations (e.g. `ctrl+a`). If the key is empty or `nil`, no physical key is registered, but the user still can create own bindings (see below).
---
--- After calling this function, key presses will cause the function `fn` to be called (unless the user remapped the key with another binding).
---
--- The `name` argument should be a short symbolic string. It allows the user to remap the key binding via input.conf using the `script-message` command, and the name of the key binding (see below for an example). The name should be unique across other bindings in the same script - if not, the previous binding with the same name will be overwritten. You can omit the name, in which case a random name is generated internally. (Omitting works as follows: either pass `nil` for `name`, or pass the `fn` argument in place of the name. The latter is not recommended and is handled for compatibility only).
---
--- The last argument is used for optional flags. This is a table, which can have the following entries:
---
---   - `repeatable`
---         If set to `true`, enables key repeat for this specific binding.
---
---   - `complex`
---         If set to `true`, then `fn` is called on both key up and down events (as well as key repeat, if enabled), with the first argument being a table. This table has the following entries (and may contain undocumented ones):
---
---       - `event`
---             Set to one of the strings `down`, `repeat`, `up` or `press` (the latter if key up/down can't be tracked).
---
---       - `is_mouse`
---             Boolean Whether the event was caused by a mouse button.
---
---       - `key_name`
---             The name of they key that triggered this, or `nil` if invoked artificially. If the key name is unknown, it's an empty string.
---
---       - `key_text`
---             Text if triggered by a text key, otherwise `nil`. See description of `script-binding` command for details (this field is equivalent to the 5th argument).
---
--- Internally, key bindings are dispatched via the `script-message-to` or `script-binding` input commands and `mp.register_script_message`.
---
--- Trying to map multiple commands to a key will essentially prefer a random binding, while the other bindings are not called. It is guaranteed that user defined bindings in the central input.conf are preferred over bindings added with this function (but see `mp.add_forced_key_binding`).
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```lua
--- function something_handler()
---     print("the key was pressed")
--- end
--- mp.add_key_binding("x", "something", something_handler)
--- ```
---
--- This will print the message `the key was pressed` when `x` was pressed.
---
--- The user can remap these key bindings. Then the user has to put the following into their input.conf to remap the command to the `y` key:
--- ```
--- y script-binding something
--- ```
---
--- This will print the message when the key `y` is pressed. (`x` will still work, unless the user remaps it.)
---
--- You can also explicitly send a message to a named script only. Assume the above script was using the filename `fooscript.lua`:
---
--- ```
--- y script-binding fooscript/something
--- ```
---
---@param key  KeybindInputKey
---@param name string
---@param fn   function
---@param rp   KeybindFlags | nil
function mp.add_key_binding(key, name, fn, rp) end

---
--- This works almost the same as `mp.add_key_binding`, but registers the key binding in a way that will overwrite the user's custom bindings in their input.conf (`mp.add_key_binding` overwrites default key bindings only, but not those by the user's `input.conf`).
---
---@overload fun(key: string, name: string, fn: function)
---@param  key  KeybindInputKey
---@param  name string
---@param  fn   function
---@param rp    KeybindFlags | nil
function mp.add_forced_key_binding(key, name, fn, rp) end

---
--- Remove a key binding added with `mp.add_key_binding` or
--- `mp.add_forced_key_binding`. Use the same name as you used when adding
--- the bindings. It's not possible to remove bindings for which you omitted
--- the name.
---
---@param name string
function mp.remove_key_binding(name) end

---@alias BindingFlags string | "'allow-vo-dragging'" | "'allow-hide-cursor'" | "'exclusive'" | "'exclusive+allow-hide-cursor'" | "'exclusive+allow-vo-dragging'" | "'allow-hide-cursor+allow-vo-dragging'" | "'exclusive+allow-hide-cursor+allow-vo-dragging'"

---
--- Enable keybindings declared in section `section`. The flags parameter can be a combination (separated by +) of the following flags:
---
--- - _`<exclusive>`_
--- All sections enabled before the newly enabled section are disabled. They will be re-enabled as soon as all exclusive sections above them are removed. In other words, the new section shadows all previous sections.
---
--- - _`<allow-hide-cursor>`_
--- _This feature can't be used through the public API_.
---
--- - _`<allow-vo-dragging>`_
--- _This feature can't be used through the public API_.

--region Event Handlers

---
--- Call a specific function when an event happens. The event name is a string, and `fn` is a function value.
---
--- Some events have associated data. This is put into a `table` and passed as argument to `fn`. The Lua table by default contains a `name` field, which is a `string` containing the event name. If the event has an error associated, the `error` field is set to a string describing the error, on success it's not set.
---
--- If multiple functions are registered for the same event, they are run in registration order, which the first registered function running before all the other ones.
---
--- Returns `true` if such an event exists, `false` otherwise.
---
--- Events are notifications from player core to scripts. You can register an event handler with `mp.register_event`.
---
--- Note that all scripts (and other parts of the player) receive events equally, and there's no such thing as blocking other scripts from receiving events.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- function my_fn(event)
---     print("start of playback!")
--- end
--- mp.register_event("file-loaded", my_fn)
--- ```
---
--- ## List of events
---
--- - _`start-file`_
--- Happens right before a new file is loaded. When you receive this, the player is loading the file (or possibly already done with it).
---
--- - _`end-file`_
--- Happens after a file was unloaded. Typically, the player will load the next file right away, or quit if this was the last file.
--- The event has the `reason` field, which takes one of these values:
---
--- - _`eof`_
--- The file has ended. This can (but doesn't have to) include incomplete files or broken network connections under circumstances.
---
--- - _`stop`_
--- Playback was ended by a command.
---
--- - _`quit`_
--- Playback was ended by sending the quit command.
---
--- - _`error`_
--- An error happened. In this case, an `error` field is present with the error string.
---
--- - _`redirect`_
--- Happens with playlists and similar. For additional details see `MPV_END_FILE_REASON_REDIRECT` in the C API.
---
--- - _`unknown`_
--- Unknown. Normally does not happen unless the Lua API is out of sync with the C API (likewise, it could happen that your script gets reason strings that did not exist yet at the time your script was written).
---
--- - _`file-loaded`_
--- Happens after a file was loaded and begins playback.
---
--- - _`seek`_
--- Happens on seeking (this might include cases when the player seeks internally, even without user interaction—e.g. segment changes when playing Matroska files with ordered chapters).
---
--- - _`playback-restart`_
--- Start of playback after seek or after file was loaded.
---
--- - _`idle`_
--- Idle mode is entered. This happens when playback ended, and the player was started with `--idle` or `--force-window`. This mode is implicitly ended when the `start-file` or `shutdown` events happen.
---
--- - _`tick`_
--- Called after a video frame was displayed. This is a hack, and you should avoid using it. Use timers instead and maybe watch pausing/unpausing events to avoid wasting CPU when the player is paused.
---
--- - _`shutdown`_
--- Sent when the player quits, and the script should terminate. Normally handled automatically. See `Details on the script initialization and lifecycle`.
---
--- - _`log-message`_
--- Receives messages enabled with `mp.enable_messages`. The message data is contained in the table passed as first parameter to the event handler.
--- The table contains, in addition to the default event fields, the following fields:
---
--- - _`prefix`_

--endregion Event Handlers

---
--- Watch a property for changes. If the property `name` is changed, then the function `fn(name)` will be called. `type` can be `nil`, or be set to one of `none`, `native`, `boolean`, `string`, or `number`.
--- `none` is the same as `nil`. For all other values, the new value of the property will be passed as second argument to `fn`, using
--- `mp.get_property_<type>` to retrieve it. This means if `type` is for example `string`, `fn` is roughly called as in
--- `fn(name, mp.get_property_string(name))`.
---
--- If possible, change events are coalesced. If a property is changed a bunch of times in a row, only the last change triggers the change function. (The exact behavior depends on timing and other things.)
---
--- In some cases the function is not called even if the property changes.
--- This depends on the property, and it's a valid feature request to ask for better update handling of a specific property.
---
--- If the `type` is `none` or `nil`, sporadic property change events are possible. This means the change function `fn` can be called even if the property doesn't actually change.
---
--- You always get an initial change notification. This is meant to initialize the user's state to the current value of the property.

---@param timer Timer
function mp.cancel_timer(timer) end

---
--- Call the given function periodically. This is like `mp.add_timeout`, but the timer is re-added after the function fn is run.
---
--- Returns a timer object. The timer object provides the following methods:
---
---   - `stop()`
---  Disable the timer. Does nothing if the timer is already disabled.
---  This will remember the current elapsed time when stopping, so that `resume()` essentially unpauses the timer.
---
---   - `kill()`
---  Disable the timer. Resets the elapsed time. `resume()` will
---  restart the timer.
---
---   - `resume()`
---  Restart the timer. If the timer was disabled with `stop()`, this will resume at the time it was stopped.
---  If the timer was disabled with `kill()`, or if it's a previously fired one-shot timer (added with `add_timeout()`), this starts the timer from the beginning, using the initially configured timeout.
---
---   - `is_enabled()`
---  Whether the timer is currently enabled or was previously disabled (e.g. by `stop()` or `kill()`).
---
---   - `timeout` (RW)
---  This field contains the current timeout period. This value is not updated as time progresses. It's only used to calculate when the timer should fire next when the timer expires.
---  If you write this, you can call `t:kill() ; t:resume()` to reset the current timeout to the new one. (`t:stop()` won't use the new timeout.)
---
---   - `oneshot` (RW)
---  Whether the timer is periodic (`false`) or fires just once (`true`). This value is used when the timer expires (but before the timer callback function fn is run).
---
--- Note that these are methods, and you have to call them using `:` insteadof `.` (Refer to <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#`3.4.9`>.)
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- seconds = 0
--- timer = mp.add_periodic_timer(1, function()
---     print("called every second")
---     -- stop it after 10 seconds
---     seconds = seconds + 1

--- end)
--- ```
---
---@param  seconds number
---@param  cb      function
---@return         Timer
function mp.add_periodic_timer(seconds, cb) end

---
--- Call the given function fn when the given number of seconds has elapsed.
--- Note that the number of seconds can be fractional. For now, the timer's resolution may be as low as 50 ms, although this will be improved in the future.
---
--- This is a one-shot timer: it will be removed when it's fired.
---
--- Returns a timer object. See `mp.add_periodic_timer` for details.
---
---@param seconds number
---@param cb      function
function mp.add_timeout(seconds, cb) end

---
--- Return the timer that expires next.
---
---@return Timer
local function get_next_timer() end

---
--- Return the relative time in seconds when the next timer (`mp.add_timeout` and similar) expires.
---
--- If there is no timer, return `nil`.
---
---@return number

---
--- Run timers that have met their deadline. Returns next absolute time a timer expires as number, or nil if no timers

---
--- If the `allow_wait` parameter is set to `true`, the function will block

---

The player will wait until all hooks are run.Ordered after `start-file` and before `playback-restart`.
---| '"on_load_fail"'         # Called after after a file has been opened, but failed to. This can be used to provide a fallback in case native demuxers failed to recognize the file, instead of always running before the native demuxers like `on_load`. Demux will only be retried if `stream-open-filename` was changed. If it fails again, this hook is _not_ called again, and loading definitely fails. Ordered after `on_load`, and before `playback-restart` and `end-file`.
---| '"on_preloaded"'         # Called after a file has been opened, and before tracks are selected and decoders are created. This has some usefulness if an API users wants to select tracks manually, based on the set of available tracks. Its also useful to initialize `--lavfi-complex` in a specific way by API, without having to "probe" the available streams at first. Note that this does not yet apply default track selection. Which operations exactly can be done and not be done, and what information is available and what is not yet available yet, is all subject to change. Ordered after `on_load_fail` etc. and before `playback-restart`.
---| '"on_unload"'            # Run before closing a file, and before actually uninitializing everything. Its not possible to resume playback in this state. Ordered before `end-file`. Will also happen in the error case (then after `on_load_fail`).
---| '"on_before_start_file"' # Run before a `start-file` event is sent. If any client changes the current playlist entry, or sends a quit command to the player, the corresponding event will not actually happen after the hook returns. Useful to drain property changes before a new file is loaded.
